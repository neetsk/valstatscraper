This application will be used as a match scraper for Valorant tournament games using the ACCOUNT-V1 and VAL-MATCH-v1 endpoints.  
Our extended friend group has grown to 30-40 players of all ranks and a tournament every few months allows us to connect outside of a ranked setting as well as play with familiar competition. 
These tournaments in the past and as of now do not have a prize pool and simply give the winners bragging rights in our group. 
The app will use Flask as the backend to connect to the API and deploy the server while displaying the data in a cleaner format using HTML, JS, and CSS. 
The backend will include SQLite as our DBMS to store past, present, and future tournament data.
